# Gabrielle Work Log

## April 19
- Created the github repo for DSS Spring 2024
- Picked datasets chosen from DSS canvas page & downloaded them into repo
	- Obesity
	- Student
	- Spotify
- Created an explore r code for each chosen dataset
- Created folders to hold datasets and exploration code

## March 22

- Copy-pasted work log from We-R-Finished into repo
- Student Exploration R Code
	- Read in dataset
	- Renamed columns
	- Went to define columns, but stopped when realizing there are a lot of inputs
	- Decided to not do student dataset (for now)
	- Included an evaluation log 
- Obesity Exploration R Code
	- Read in dataset
	- Renamed some columns
	- Turned categorical cols into factors for summary
- Spotify Exploration R Code
	- Read in dataset
	- Viewed dataset for further consideration
	- Zayne has done something similar with this, probably would need more time
	- Especially since this includes songs, maybe group into genre?
	- No, there's multiple tags in genre, this could be difficult
- Obesity will be the one I'll use for the project

## May 2

	- Got as far as the linears and beginnings of two predictors

## May 3
